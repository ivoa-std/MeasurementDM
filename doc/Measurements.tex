\begin{abstract}
  In creating version 2 of ``\emph{Space-Time Coordinate Metadata for the Virtual Observatory}'' (STC) \citep{2007ivoa.spec.1030R} Data Model, it was decided to split the content into various component models which focus on particular aspects of the previous model scope.  
  
  This model covers the description of measured or determined astronomical data, and includes the following concepts:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The association of the determined 'value' with corresponding errors.  In this model, the 'value' is given by the various Coordinate types of the Coordinates data model \citep{std:Coords}.
  \item A description of the Error model.
  \end{itemize}

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
The collection and analysis of observed or derived data is the foundation of Astronomy.  
These data form the core of our most fundamental products:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Observational data - raw data in detector coordinates and instrumental units.
  \item Derived data products - images and tables of derived data in physical units and coordinate spaces.
  \item Simulated data - data derived from simulation of physical entities and instrumentation.
  \item Catalogs - collections of properties associated with various astronomical sources derived from multiple observations of those sources.
\end{itemize}

Performing astronomical data analysis in the Virtual Observatory means to discover, evaluate, 
extract, combine and manipulate data which may have been obtained at different times, 
with different instruments, and from different locations.  To confidently execute this workflow 
requires a complete and accurate description of the nature of the data and its associated errors.  

The ``\emph{Astronomical Coordinates and Coordinate Systems}'' (Coords) \citep{std:Coords} Data Model provides the description of the nature of the data values, the Coordinate space, reference frame, domain, etc.  Here, we utilize that information to build a model for observed or derived data which adds elements quantifying the accuracy of the data.

\subsection{Context and Scope}

This document results from updating the ``\emph{Space-Time Coordinate Metadata for the Virtual Observatory}'' (STC) \citep{2007ivoa.spec.1030R} model for use in VO-DML compliant models.  That model provides metadata for describing Space-Time related, and other Coordinates including associated errors.  These metadata are to be used for specifying coordinate-related information for datasets, catalogs, and queries.  In this work, our primary focus is to support the use cases described below, while keeping the broader scope in mind to inform design decisions for future expansion.

The update and revision of the STC model has sub-divided the content into component models, each covering a portion of the scope of the parent model.  This allows for better description of the relations between the various components, allows for independent development of the component models, and creates smaller, more digestible content for users.

In the astronomical community, the terms ``quantity'', ``coordinate'', and ``measurement'' are used interchangably, but not always with the same meaning.  The ``coordinate'' of a star is typically a measured location, while the ``coordinate'' of the center of a circular region is not.  We provide here a short glossary of these terms in the IVOA data model context.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quantity: [ivoa model]  A number with a unit.
  \item Coordinate: [coords model]  An absolute location within a coordinate space.  Comprised of a 'value' (often a Quantity), associated with an axis in a coordinate space, and a coordinate frame providing additional metadata about the orientation and origin of the coordinate space.  In other words, a location in a domain space.
  \item Measurement: [meas model]  For 'measured', or 'determined' data.  Combines a Coordinate (ie: the determined value) with corresponding Error(s).  For the majority of cases dealing with astronomical data, this is what we are referring to.
\end{itemize}

This document describes the Measurement model which provides descriptions for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The observed or derived data 'value'.
  \item The error(s) associated with that 'value'.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases and Requirements}
\label{sect:ucreq}

\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{sect:usecases}

This is a core data model, intended to be used within other models describing higher level products.
As such, there are a vast number of usage threads which the model is required to support.  Rather than
enumerating individual usage threads here, we describe the concepts which must be covered and criteria
which must be met to facilitate these various usage threads.

\subsubsection{Cube model support}
\label{uc:Cube-model-support}
  The primary use case for this work is in support of the Cube Data Model (CubesDM);
  a N-Dimensional model for pixelated images and sparse cube data. 
 
  The following is a brief outline of the most relevant features pertaining to the
  development of this model.  Many of these features are handled by the Coordinates or Transform models,
  we mention them here at a high level to convey the relation between the models.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item General
    \begin{itemize}

      \item At the most basic level, the measurement associates a measured or determined value with one or more errors.
      \item Most data contained within a cube fall within the scope of the Measurement model, regardless of whether or not errrors are actually provided.
      \item The value itself, along with any associated metadata describing the domain space in which it resides is relegated to the Coordinates model.  This includes:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item coordinate space definitions: dimensionality, axis configuration, axis ranges, etc
          \item coordinate frames: ancillary metadata related to the domain space such as the origin (reference position), orientation (reference frame), etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Pixelated Image Cube
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The specification of the image pixel domain is relegated to the Coordinates model.
      \item The image cell value is considered within the scope of this model.
      \item The image cell value is typically given in a physical domain, but may be mapped to other representations or domains via transform operations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sparse Cube \\
      The Sparse Cube is structurally different from a Pixelated Image, but contains many of the same concepts.
      To facilitate the development of efficient, reusable code, the models should use the same objects in
      these various contexts wherever feasible.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The data cover a wide array of physical domains including, but not limited to Spatial, Temporal, Spectral, Polarization
      \item Individual domains may be represented multiple times. e.g. multiple positions, fluxes in different bands.
      \item The measure values themselves, and associated metadata are relegated to the Coordinates model.
      \item These values may have associated errors..
        \begin{itemize}
           \item Errors must be dimensionally compatible with the associated values
        \end{itemize}
      \item Errors may stem from various sources.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item for this version of the model, we limit the options to one systematic, and one statistical error source.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Physical Data (Observables) \\
       Sparse cubes contain a wide variety of observable data.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item It is impractical to describe each as a specialized type, so this model must support a simple description applicable to any 1-dimensional data.
       \item To facilitate usage in automated systems, the physical nature (domain) of each observable should be easily discerned.
         For example, 'find and plot the time and magnitude data from this cube.'
       \item Some domains have special constraints on the data values, and/or have special importance in other models.
         To help ensure a consistent definition in each context, we represent these with specialized classes in the model. \\
         e.g. the target position must be a spatial Position, observation date must be a Time, etc.
       \item In many use cases, the value domain space is irrelevant or can be implied.  In others, physical constraints, environmental factors,
         or instrumental limitations may require the explicit specification of the domain space.  To keep a simple and consistent model
         which facilitates code generation and reuse, all cases should be handled in the same manner.  However, the models must not require this metadata be provided.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Errors (Uncertainties)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In multi-dimensional data errors may range from very simple and uncorrelated, to very complex and/or correlated between any of the given axes.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item for this version of the model, we limit the scope to a very simple error model.
         \item additional usage threads involving more complex error handling will drive the evolution of the error model.
      \end{itemize}
      \item This version of the model should support the more commonly used forms.  Possible examples include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item symmetric( +/- a )
        \item asymmetric( +a:-b )
        \item interval ( a:b )
        \item matrix
        \item elliptical
        \item quality indicators:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item global status, typically numeric
            \item bit array, where each bit is associated with a particular quality state 
         \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
      \item Virtual data should accommodate the transform of errors as well as the coordinates themselves.
        \begin{itemize}
           \item this feature is implicitly supported by applying a transform to a Measure rather than a Coordinate.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

    \item [\textbf{[meas.004]:}] Errors may be correlated between component values ( ie: may apply to coordinate set as a whole )
    \item [\textbf{[meas.005]:}] Values associated with different domains may have correlated errors (ie: components of coordinate tuple may refer to different domains, and have non-separable errors)
    \item [\textbf{[meas.006]:}] Shall support the most common error forms, including, but not limited to: Symmetrical, Asymmetrical, Interval, Elliptical \\ with assumed Gaussian distribution at a 1-sigma confidence level.
